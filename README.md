# interest areas
- [myDiabetesIQ](http://www.mywaydigitalhealth.co.uk/)

- use of Recurrent Neural Networks / Convolutional Neural Networks to extract information from time-series data in diabetes to allow regression / classification analysis. Applications include [prediction of mortality from HbA1c time series analysis](https://github.com/csainsbury/bagOfDrugs/tree/master/local_py), [prediction of inpatient outcomes from pre-admission data](https://github.com/csainsbury/machineLearning.hypoglycaemiaDuringAdmission) and [individualised virtual n=1 drug trials to allow optimum drug selection](https://github.com/csainsbury/nEqOneTrial)

- [use of unsupervised ML algorithms to identify incorrected entered data within large scale diabetes datasets](https://github.com/csainsbury/t1_t2_ANN)

- continuous risk stratification of inpatients with diabetes
- association of inpatient glucose metrics and long term outcomes
- mechanisms linking glucose and CV risk in diabetes
- [problem drug use and diabetes](https://github.com/csainsbury/problemDrugUse.diabetes)
- cystic fibrosis related diabetes
- multiscale variability in glucose metrics and association with outcome
- [efficacy of structured intervention on glycaemic endpoints](https://github.com/csainsbury/DICE)
