### workflow
we use [slack](https://diabetesresearch.slack.com/messages/) for communication, [trello](https://trello.com) for project organisation and [google docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) for writing collaboratively. this ensures that there is only ever a single copy of any document. we use [paperpile](https://paperpile.com/app) for reference management - greg can give you an access code.
