## introduction to deep learning
### general resources
there are many great resources to introduce the concepts and principles behind deep learning.
some of the best online resources include: [machine learning mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/), [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=deep+learning+tutorial+). there are also paid courses (eg [data camp](https://www.datacamp.com/), [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)) and tutorials at sites such as [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

### languages and libraries
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/)
- [keras](https://keras.io/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

### recommended IDEs
- [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/): best for R
- [atom](https://atom.io/): best for python

### workflow
we use [slack](https://diabetesresearch.slack.com/messages/) for communication, [trello](https://trello.com) for project organisation and [google docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) for writing collaboratively. this ensures that there is only ever a single copy of any document.
